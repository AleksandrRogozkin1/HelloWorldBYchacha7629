# HelloWorld in leo 😍


Unexpectedly for everyone (even for me) after part 5 of the Leo tutorials, it’s not part 6, but 0. All because one day my creative genius realized that our tutorial series lacks a starting point where I will explain the introductory moments. Moreover, from reluctance to increase the numbers of all parts by 1, an insight descended on me that you can simply call the first part zero (programmer moment). Thus, I ask you to start understanding leo from this simple project.
